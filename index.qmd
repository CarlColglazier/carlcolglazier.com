:::{#hero-heading}

<!--## Welcome to my home on the information superhighway-->

I am a PhD candidate in [Technology and Social Behavior](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/) (a dual degree in computer science & communication studies) at Northwestern University where I am affiliated with the [Community Data Science Collective](https://communitydata.science/).

My [research](/research/) focuses on decentralized social networks like the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) and their role as sociotechnical systems. My research often uses [computational social science](https://carlcolglazier.github.io/css-syllabus/syllabus.html) to investigate how these systems handle "tricky problems" like content moderation and discovery.

<!--
At North Carolina State University, I graduated in 2019 with a B.S. in
Computer Science and a B.A. in Communication Media. Previously, I worked as intern in full stack software engineering at IBM and as an undergraduate researcher at the Center for Research Computing at the University of Notre Dame.
-->

These days, I am most active on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/carl.cx) and likely [writing notes in Obsidian, programs in some VS Code variant, and everything else in Emacs](/tools/).
