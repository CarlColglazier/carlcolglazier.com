I am an incoming PhD student in Technology and Social Behavior at
Northwestern University, where I plan to study media systems and
their impact on public discourse.  I am also interested in the
relationship between online and offline communities and /how/ and
/why/ people use media to spread information over networks.

At North Carolina State University, I graduated in 2019 with a B.S. in
Computer Science and a B.A. in Communication Media.  I am an alumni of
the [[https://caldwellfellows.ncsu.edu/][Caldwell Fellows]] and the [[https://ids.chass.ncsu.edu/dual/franklin.php][Benjamin Franklin Scholars]].

Outside of academia, I get hands-on with media through [[/code][coding
projects]], [[/films][documentary filmmaking]], bedroom music production, and
vlogging.

My research investigates the design of media systems and their impact on public discourse. I view mediated communication as a negotiation between multiple parties---including media, platforms, moderators, producers, and readers. Thus, I employ a combination of methods from computational social science and media studies to understand both sender and receiver perspectives.
