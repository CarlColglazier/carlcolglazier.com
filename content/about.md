My name is Carl Colglazier and I am an undergraduate student
from Raleigh, North Carolina.

Rooted in my dual education background
in computer science and communication, I want to use my experience to
help **make meaningful information useful and accessible**. My approach to
software development draws from my interdisciplinary perspective: I
view the use of computer programs as a form of media interaction
motivated by the concerns of human beings.
