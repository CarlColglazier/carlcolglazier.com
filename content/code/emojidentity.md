We propose a measure for group identity on Twitter using emoji
displayed by users in their names or biographies. Viewing the use of
emoji as social phenomenon, we introduce methods for measuring how
often emoji users follow/friend other emoji users compared to
non-emoji users. Furthermore, we introduce methods to measure quantify
the frequency users friend/follow users with similar emojis,
concluding with visual analysis of what ties between certain emoji
look like.
