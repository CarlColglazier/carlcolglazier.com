Rooted in my dual education in computer science and
communication, I **make meaningful information
accessible** with new media, social computing, and
computational social science. My media background is
rooted in documentary filmmaking and this perspective
continues to influence my approach to research and
writing.

At North Carolina State University in Raleigh, I am a senior studying
computer science and communication (media). I graduate December 2019.

I am
a [Caldwell Fellow](https://caldwellfellows.ncsu.edu/) and [Benjamin Franklin Scholar](https://ids.chass.ncsu.edu/dual/franklin.php).

This summer, I am working as a Full Stack Developer Intern at IBM.
I have also worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the
Center for Research Computing at the University of Notre Dame
and at the Department of History at NC State.
