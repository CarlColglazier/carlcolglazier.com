Rooted in my dual education in computer science and
communication, I **make meaningful information
accessible** using new media, social computing, and
computational social science.

At North Carolina State University in Raleigh, I am a senior studying
computer science and communication (media). I am
a [Caldwell Fellow][caldwell] and [Benjamin Franklin Scholar][bfs].

This summer, I am working as a Full Stack Developer Intern at IBM.
