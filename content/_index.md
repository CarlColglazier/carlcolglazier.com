I am an undergraduate student from Raleigh, North Carolina.

Rooted in my dual education background in computer science and
communication, my goal is to help **make meaningful information useful
and accessible** using new media studies, social computing, and
computational social science.

At North Carolina State University, I am a [Caldwell Fellow][caldwell]
and [Benjamin Franklin Scholar][bfs].
