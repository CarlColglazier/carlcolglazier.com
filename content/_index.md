At North Carolina State University in Raleigh, I am a senior studying
computer science and communication (media). I graduate December 2019.

I am
a [Caldwell Fellow](https://caldwellfellows.ncsu.edu/) and [Benjamin Franklin Scholar](https://ids.chass.ncsu.edu/dual/franklin.php).

This summer, I am working as a Full Stack Developer Intern at IBM.
I have also worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the
Center for Research Computing at the University of Notre Dame
and at the Department of History at NC State.
