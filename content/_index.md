I am a first-year PhD student in Technology and Social Behavior at
Northwestern University. I study media as sociotechnical systems and
their impact on public discourse.  I am also interested in the
relationship between online and offline communities and _how_ and
_why_ people use media to spread information over networks.

At North Carolina State University, I graduated in 2019 with a B.S. in
Computer Science and a B.A. in Communication Media.  I am an alumni of
the [Caldwell Fellows](https://caldwellfellows.ncsu.edu/) and the [Benjamin Franklin Scholars](https://ids.chass.ncsu.edu/dual/franklin.php).

Outside of academia, I get hands-on with media through [coding
projects](/code), [documentary filmmaking](/films), bedroom music production, and
vlogging.
