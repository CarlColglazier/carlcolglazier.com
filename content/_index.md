I graduated in 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Communication Media from North Carolina State University in Raleigh.
I am an alumni of the [Caldwell Fellows](https://caldwellfellows.ncsu.edu/) and the [Benjamin Franklin Scholars](https://ids.chass.ncsu.edu/dual/franklin.php). Currently, I am a PhD applicant, working to continue my research at the intersection of media, technology, and society.

Outside of academia, I get hands-on with media through [coding projects](/code), [documentary filmmaking](/films), bedroom music production, and vlogging.
