I am an undergraduate student at North Carolina State University
working toward degrees in computer science and communication; I want
to use what I learn to *make meaningful information useful and
accessible*.

Some of my academic interests include concurrency, quantitative
research, media studies, and computational social science. I also
enjoy exploring the creative process through music, photography, and
film. Thoughts on these and other subjects can be found on this
website.
