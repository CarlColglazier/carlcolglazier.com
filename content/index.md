I am an undergraduate student at North Carolina State University
working toward degrees in computer science and communication; I want
to use what I learn to *make meaningful information useful and
accessible*.


My primary academic interests are new media studies, computational
social science, and computer performance. I also enjoy exploring the
creative process through music, photography, and film. Thoughts on
these and other subjects can be found on this website.
