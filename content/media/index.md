Music

["Thebes"](https://coalglazer.bandcamp.com/track/thebes)
: Thebes is inspired by the ancient Greek tragedy Antigone. The play, written by Sophocles many years ago, tells a tale of conflict between law and justice and a grave consequence of power. The piece was primarily created using a combination of additive synthesis and temporally distorted acoustic instruments.
