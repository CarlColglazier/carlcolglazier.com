> *What are your favorite programming languages?*

Python, Rust, and LISP.

Python has a fantastic suite of libraries that can do almost anything
with minimal effort.

I admire Rust's design principles. Its focus on safety and security is
useful in a number of contexts and programming in it gave me a much
clearer understanding of memory management.

In a similar way, my experiences in LISP have dramatically changed the
way I view programming.

> *What text editor do you use?*

Emacs (usually).

> *Why do you study communication/media?*

Marshall McLuhan coined the phrase "the medium is the message" to
describe how new forms of media (such as the printed word, television,
or the internet) have such a great effect on the human experience that
the medium itself embeds itself into any message it conveys. Currently
emerging forms of media are rooted increasingly in computers and our
access to them, which embeds itself into any message sent over digital
communication systems.

While studying computer science gives insight on the processes and
development techniques behind software, I believe that studying
communication offers insights into the human effects and social
consequences of software.
