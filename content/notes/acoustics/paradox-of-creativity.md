**Creativity is mythologized.**

Many times we think of creativity like the ouroboros, an ancient
symbol of a snake eating its own tail. We think of creative people as
those who are able to come up with original ideas out of thin air and
transform these ideas into creative masterpieces. We are not quite
sure what goes on in that process, but we know that our favorite
artists, writers, and musicians have some speical ability that we
reuglar folks do not have.

Countless people can read and write proficiently, but few have ever
written a substantive written work. We tell ourselves that we just
don't have the natural talent. A psychologist might diagnose us with a
harsh case of cognitive dissonance; it is easier to believe that a
successful pursuit of creativity is beyond our grasps than to take
action to bring it within our reach.

**Creativity is intimidating.**

When engaging in a creative pursuit, we are setting ourselves up for
failure. After all, creativity is a process of constant
failure. Regardless of medium, it takes a tremendous amount of
practice for us to be able to achieve a creative vision and it takes
an equal amount of studying to conceive that vision in the first
place.

Starting a creative project is not the difficult part for me. It is
not uncommon to experience a flurry of creative energy in the
beginning of a project. I have an idea or a concept that I want to
see reach its potential. Soon, however, I realize that my initial
idea was incomplete or too fuzzy to know what to do next.

**Creativity is hard work.**

This summer, I worked on creating a series of folktronica songs using
primarily my mandolin and an analogue synthesizer. The synthesizer
itself was a new tool to my process and I really enjoyed exploring how
it fit into my workflow. I like the songs that I created quite a bit
and some have made it over that hump of initial creative energy;
others still need refinement, a bridge, or more time to see where they
will go.

Through this process, I think I learned a few ways to stimulate my
own creative process. I found it incredibly encouraging to engage in
my creative medium with other people. Every Tuesday evening, I and a
few friends would break out a song book and play music just for the fun
of it. While these songs did not relate directly to the music I was working
on, it helped to break the monotony of practicing on an uncomfortable chair
with dorm room acoustics. I also found our group's different musical tastes,
approaches, and interests refreshing.

I also learned a few techniques for handling the temporal aspects of
creativity. While I often worked during time I set aside specifically
for creative work, I also found it useful to carry a notebook and
a portable audio recorder around for when I came up with something
outside of that space. This helped me to deal with my biggest creative
struggle: time. Creativity demands our time--the type of time that
requires our energy.

**Creativity is worth it.**

Creativity does not exist in a vacuum. No person is simply a creative
person; in contrast, we all have the ability to create, but it is not
easy. Creativity requires that we conscientiously work to improve our
craft. Creativity requires that we think big and challenge ourselves
to embrace being uncomfortable.

Instead of an ouroboros, the creative process is more like a tangled
knot of a million snakes each pulling and intertwining on each other.
It may not be as clean or pretty of an analogy, but the results show
that the effort is worthwhile.
