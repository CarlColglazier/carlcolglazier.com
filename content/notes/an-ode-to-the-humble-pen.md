_After Wendell Berry_

Ever since this summer, I have made it a personal project of mine to
improve my cursive shorthand, a skill which is seemingly diminishing
in Western society.  After going through two disposable pens in half
as many months this semester, I eventually decided to succumb to a
year-long interest and become the overzealous owner of a fountain pen.

To contrast with my previous post on how much I am relying on
computers in my studies, I would like to spend this next post praising
the humble pen:

1.  It is quite challenging to be distracted by one's own notes.
2.  The pen can handle just about any layout imaginable; no special
    software necessary!
3.  Writing in a pen forces you to only transcribe what is important,
    possibly leading to better notes.
