This page will be out of date pretty quickly, but I wanted to compile a nice list at least once.

-   [Lines](https://llllllll.co/).
-   [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).
-   [SuperCollider Forum](https://scsynth.org/).
-   [TOPLAP Forum](https://forum.toplap.org/).
-   [r/popheads on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/).

Will add more as I think of them!
