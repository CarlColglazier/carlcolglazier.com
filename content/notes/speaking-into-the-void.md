How do we measure...well, anything? In research design,
_operationalization_ describes how we transform the intangible into a
measurable variable. How do you measure an abstract concept like
violence or happiness? The trick is to tally some other variable
which closely correlates with the desired variable.

Of course, any such measure isn't going to be perfect. In fact, bad
assumptions behind operationalizations can easily throw everything
off. Thus this is often the step where research gets messy. By
definition, if the construct could be empirically measured, an
operationalization wouldn't be necessary in the first place. This
leaves open room for a disconnect, which risks pushing the researcher
toward an incorrect conclusion.

Take this example. You want to know how much I like the taste of
coffee. To measure this, you take samples of my coffee consumption
over time. The assumption behind this operationalization is that the
more I like the taste of coffee, the more I would consume. Now if you
sampled my beverage consumption some weeks, you might conclude that I
don't like coffee at all: bodies are fragile things and sometimes I
must forgo my daily cup(s)-of-joe for my health. Do my periods
avoiding coffee mean I don't like it? Hardly, but if we tried to
measure enjoyment of a beverage through these samples, we might end
up reaching the wrong conclusion: that I don't like
coffee&nbsp;[^fn:1], when in reality I am just avoiding the
potential for acid reflux.


## What's the goal? {#what-s-the-goal}

Operationalization becomes particularly important when organizations
handle large quantities of data at scale. At a certain point, data
become too overwhelming for a system based on manual
decision-making. The usual response becomes automation, which can
have unconsidered second-order effects.

A few years ago, YouTube made a big change when they redefined
they mean by a "view". The site used to run rampant with clickbait
content that people would only watch for maybe a few seconds at
most. Because views were _the_ important measure and because even the
shortest watch-time counted for a view, this incentivized some to
create a lot of bad content---the kind that people would click away
from within seconds. In short, YouTube's operationalization for views
encouraged spam and click-bait.

They changed this several years ago, making their definition more
subtle and contextual. You might notice that I'm being pretty vague
here. That's intentional as YouTube does not release a lot themselves
on how they count views. After all, if they told people their precise
methods, that would make it easier to cheat.

Views, however, are no longer king on the site. Instead, YouTube has
moved toward "time watched" as its primary metric. This is harder to
game and rewards videos that keep people glued to the site for longer
periods of time.

This thought dump goes back to motivation. Why do I write? Why do I
post online? Who is my audience and what do they (and I) want?

If there is one thing I've learned about myself, it is that I can be
highly motivated by boredom. I'm happiest with my mind engaged on
solving some problem---even one of my own creation. So that's kind of
what I plan to do, at least for the time being. I think there's a
huge pressure in many online spaces to reduce yourself to a brand.
YouTube, for instance, [suggests channels discover and stick to a
specific niche](https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/lesson/niche). Fair advice if you are trying to grow on the
platform, but this approach may not be best for everyone.

In my head, my niche is broad: media. It's what I study and my
primary personal interest as well. A lot of things fit in that label:
I define media as tools which transform our view of space and time.
This is pretty broad[^fn:2]. I see the overlap, but it's less
clear if anyone else would. No matter.


## Who sets the goal? {#who-sets-the-goal}

It's easy to simply chase goals without realizing it. What is the
"goal" of a place like Facebook? I'd say it's to connect with people,
but in practice I mostly just lurk and occasionally like. In effect, I
follow Facebook's designed for consumption:
open the website, scroll infinitely, and occasionally interact with
some content so they can collect information on your interests.

I think it's important to be clear, honest, and intentional to ourselves about what we want out of a platform. Otherwise, we tend to drift toward the default behavior. And that behavior is rarely in our best interest.

[^fn:1]: You could make the counterargument here that enjoyment includes the entire experience of consumption. In this case, it would include the potential for acid reflux, which is enough to sour the entire experience. This is a fair point.
[^fn:2]: And this is also clearly inspired by Harold Innis.
