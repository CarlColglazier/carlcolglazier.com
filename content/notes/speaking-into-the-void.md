This thought dump goes back to motivation. Why do I write? Why do I
post online? Who is my audience and what do they (and I) want?

If there is one thing I've learned about myself, it is that I can be
highly motivated by boredom. I'm happiest with my mind engaged on
solving some problem---even one of my own creation. So that's kind of
what I plan to do, at least for the time being. I think there's a hugo
pressure in many online spaces to reduce yourself to a brand.
YouTube, for instance, [suggests channels discover and stick to a
specific niche](https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/lesson/niche). Fair advice if you are trying to grow on the platform,
but this approach may not be best for everyone.

In my head, my niche is very broad: media. It's what I study and my
primary personal interest as well. A lot of things fit in that label:
I define media as tools which transform our view of space and time.
This is pretty broad[^fn:1]. I see the overlap, but it's less clear
if anyone else would. No matter.

[^fn:1]: And this is also clearly inspired by Harold Innis.
