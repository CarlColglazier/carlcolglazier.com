Here's a handy little feature I hacked together this weekend. [Webmention](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) is a W3C recommendation for a protocol to notify a URL when a website links to it. It reminds me of the Pingback feature I used in my Wordpress days.

You can find a list of all the pages mentioning this under the "Mentions" heading below. If you would like to mention this page, there is also a form. Add this page as a link to your page, add it to the input, and click "Submit Webmention". If everything goes right, your page should then be linked below.
