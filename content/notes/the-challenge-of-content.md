This is a video about three things: cleaning, curves, and content.

Content is a catch-all term for media distributed through online
platforms. Many popular websites are now shared spaces that
essentially serve other people's stuff. It's a two-way relationship:
people publish where there are eyeball and readers don't want to miss
out on where everything is happening.

These spaces' allure comes from how they constantly serve something
fresh, media whose popularity generally follows a power law
probability distribution. In fact, if you graph the views for each of
my videos on this channel by the end of 2014 sorted by rank, the
distribution pretty closely matches Zipf's law, the value of the
maximum divided by the rank.

This makes me ponder a question: if the most popular content
will always outstrip their peers, how do I view the rest?

Is this content just accumulated junk in need of an occasional cleaning
or something more?
It's easy to see them as failures, unable to reach the success of my
top work. Then again, I didn't see them that way when I created, packaged,
and delivered them.

Part of the challenge of creating any kind of content, then,
is accepting a good portion of your work simply won't live up
to your highlights. I think the key is to give it your best
effort anyways.

With experience, we get better at things. At a certain point;
however, the returns diminish. The hard thing about learning
is you don't know what the curve looks like, nor do you know
your location on it.

There are thus two ways to judge your ability. Either you compare
it to the rest of your work or you compare it to what your peers
are doing. This is where it's important to be careful: it can be
unhealthy to lean too far one way or another.

The pleasant takeaway from all this, nonetheless, is if you are
getting better, what you make will improve as well.
