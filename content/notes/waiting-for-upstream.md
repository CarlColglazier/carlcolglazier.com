This is a post about this website. It's also a small reflection on software development.

This website has always relied on JavaScript in some way. At the moment, none runs on the site itself, but it's always been a part of the build process. Gulp, grunt, just plain npm---I think I've tried all of them at some point.

From today forward, everything on these pages is generated with a single Hugo command.

Software with a large community of contributors brings advantages. I obviously was not the only person with this kind of minification workflow. Now I am able to upgrade

Jekyll and Hugo both tally roughly the same GitHub star count.
