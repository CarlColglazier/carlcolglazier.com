title: Goals
---

The following page contains information regarding some of the aspirations which
I am working to attain.

Long-term
=========

**Studies** - As an undergraduate student at North Carolina State University,
I am reading in the fields of computer science and communication. Since
both of these studies tend to go in depth on their own specifics,
I am also augmenting these studies with a personal investment in the classical
liberal arts.

**Literature** - I am very slowly making a dent in the world's
extensive body of literature. Let me know if there is a great work I
have yet to read!


**Listening** - Just as with my immersion into literature, I am taking a
breadth-based approach to my music listening. I listen to an average of five
to ten new albums a week from a variety of genres and traditions.

**Music** - Of course, I do not spend all of my time simply absorbing the works
of others; I also enjoy creating new things in response to what I see around me.
Perhaps my favorite creative outlet is music. I am a classically trained pianist
and have recently begun to work on learning the mandolin as well.

**Productivity** - Speaking of time, I have come to realize that I have a
plethora of interests and only so much time with which to pursue them. As such,
I take a number of measures in order to try to increase my productivity as much
as possible. I have written about some of these techniques on this page and in
other places on this website.

Daily
=====

Habits make up a large basis of who we are. As a consequence, I use daily habits
extensively in order to keep up with my long-term goals over time.

**Flashcards** - Using an open-source spaced repetition software
called [Anki], I spend about a half-hour a day improving on a vast
variety of knowledge in subjects such as literature, art history,
classical music, language, and just about anything else I deem worth
memorizing. I have also begun to use Anki as an aid in my studies,
creating flash cards for practice problems and other class
knowledge. This has the distinct advantage of allowing the computer to
determine when I need to review a subject, making brushing up for
exams later in the semester much more manageable. I would recommend
Anki or a similar spaced repetition software to anyone who would
attempt to improve their knowledge and memory.


**Calendar/To-do Lists** - Without my calendar and to-do lists, I would have no
ability to keep up with all of the tasks I must complete throughout the day. I
currently use Google Calendar in combination with Google Tasks to keep track of
everything I have to do at a given time or day.
