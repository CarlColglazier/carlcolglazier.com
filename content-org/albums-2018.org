If your social media feed is anything like mine, you probably
see a lot of posts like this toward the end of the year.

[[file:images/spotify_unwrapped_2018_promo.jpg]]

It can be fun to see what kind of music other people like and to share
your own music tastes. It's also a great advertisement campaign for
Spotify (see their nice logo in the top left of these graphics).

The only problem for me is that I'm not a Spotify user, so when I try
to open my #2018Wrapped data, I am greeted with a very nicely packaged
empty box. Fortunately, as I wrote about in my [[/notes/2017-albums-in-2018/][last post]], I log all
of my music streaming using a free, open-source service called
ListenBrainz. I am going to use that data to create my own end-of-year
music graphic similar to the ones posted by my friends who use Spotify.

*** The Data
I'm doing this project in R for a couple of reasons. First of all, I
kind of like R. Honestly this wasn't the case a few years ago. It has
tons of great stats tools, but a lot of things are very much designed
for statisticians. 

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session
print("starts")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| x      |
|--------|
| starts |

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :var lb="../datasets/music-data-2018.json" :results silent
library("jsonlite")
library("tidyverse")
library("xml2")
library("RCurl")
library("scales")
library("purrrlyr")
plays <- fromJSON(lb)
#+END_SRC

I'm only interested in my activity from 2018, so I will filter
my dataset down to only the entries with a timecode in 2018.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :colnames no
stamp <- as.numeric(as.POSIXct("2018-01-01", format="%Y-%m-%d"))
recentPlays <- plays[plays$timestamp >= stamp, ]
recentPlays <- as_tibble(recentPlays[c("artist_name", "track_name", "release_name", "timestamp")])
nrow(recentPlays)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 13226

That's a lot of music! How was that listening distributed over time? 

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :exports both :results value file :var fname="images/2018_music_week_distribution_hist.png" :colnames no
  recentPlays$date <- as.Date(as.POSIXct(recentPlays$timestamp, origin="1970-01-01"))
  plot <- ggplot(recentPlays, aes(format(recentPlays$date, "%Y-%U"))) +
      geom_bar(stat = "count") +
      labs(x = "Week", title="Tracks streamed per week.") +
      theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 0),
            panel.border = element_blank(),
            legend.key = element_blank(),
            panel.background = element_blank(),
            plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent",colour = NA)
      )
  ggsave(file=fname, plot=plot, width=7, height=4, dpi=300, bg="transparent")
  fname
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: Tracks streamed per week.
#+RESULTS:

**** Top Artists
We can use this data to answer some pretty easy questions. For
example, who were my top artists in 2018?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :colnames yes
  top_artists <-recentPlays %>%
      count(artist_name, sort=T)
  top_artists %>% head()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| artist_name             |   n |
|-------------------------+-----|
| Charli XCX              | 870 |
| Carly Rae Jepsen        | 427 |
| Ariana Grande           | 311 |
| Kacey Musgraves         | 277 |
| Marina And The Diamonds | 223 |
| Lady Gaga               | 215 |

**** Top Songs

I can also do something similar to find my top tracks for the year.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  recentPlays %>%
      count(artist_name, track_name, sort=T) %>%
      head(5)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| artist_name | track_name                                                |  n |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----|
| SOPHIE      | Immaterial                                                | 41 |
| Charli XCX  | No Angel                                                  | 40 |
| Charli XCX  | I Got It (feat. Brooke Candy, CupcakKe and Pabllo Vittar) | 36 |
| Charli XCX  | Focus                                                     | 34 |
| Charli XCX  | Lucky                                                     | 33 |

I listen to a /lot/ of Charli XCX, so this list doesn't really have a
lot of variety (though Charli is absolutely one of the most versatile
artists in pop today). Let's filter the results to only show one song
per artist.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :colnames yes
  top_songs <- recentPlays %>%
      group_by(artist_name, track_name) %>%
      count(sort=T) %>%
      ungroup() %>%
      distinct(artist_name, .keep_all=T) %>%
      head(5)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| artist_name      | track_name    |  n |
|------------------+---------------+----|
| SOPHIE           | Immaterial    | 41 |
| Charli XCX       | No Angel      | 40 |
| Troye Sivan      | My My My!     | 32 |
| Kacey Musgraves  | High Horse    | 31 |
| Carly Rae Jepsen | Party For One | 26 |

**** Top Albums

ListenBrainz also logs the release name, so it's pretty easy
to compile a list of my top albums.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results value
  topAlbums <- recentPlays %>%
      group_by(artist_name, release_name) %>%
      count(sort=T)
  topAlbums %>% head()
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: My most-streamed albums of 2018.
#+RESULTS:
| artist_name             | release_name     |   n |
|-------------------------+------------------+-----|

| Kacey Musgraves         | Golden Hour      | 247 |
| Carly Rae Jepsen        | Emotion (Deluxe) | 191 |
| Marina And The Diamonds | Electra Heart    | 179 |
| Charli XCX              | Number 1 Angel   | 153 |
| Ariana Grande           | Dangerous Woman  | 144 |

Let's say I just want to know which albums from the last year
I streamed.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session
  getAlbum <- function(row) {

      groupData <- read_xml(mburl)
      xml_ns_strip(groupData)
      release <- xml_find_first(groupData, '//release[@ns2:score=100]')
      xml_ns_strip(release)
      # If it is empty
      if (class(release) == "xml_missing") {
          release <- xml_new_document() %>% xml_add_child("")
      }
      # Go with the earliest release date given.

      return(df)
  }
#+END_SRC

**** Minutes streamed
Initially I considered a brute-force approach to this problem.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  getLengths <- function(row) {
       song_stripped <- trimws(sub("\\(.*\\)", "", row$track_name))
       mburl <- sprintf(

           curlEscape(row$artist_name),
           curlEscape(song_stripped)
       )
       # To comply with the rate limit.
       Sys.sleep(0.5)
       albumData <- read_xml(mburl)
       xml_ns_strip(albumData)
       length <- xml_integer(xml_find_first(albumData, "//length"))
       return(length)
   }
#+END_SRC

**** Top Genre
Observation: the top quartile of artists make up the vast
majority of my streams this year.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  top_artist_ids <- recentAlbums %>%

* DONE Albums from 2017 I'm Still Listening to in 2018

I listen to a /lot/ of music. While I will listen to some albums a
few times and move on, some stay with me. This post quantifies the
albums from 2017 that stayed in my life in 2018.

# more

Each December, I compile [[https://gist.github.com/CarlColglazier/913963cc7197fb7a024d736c96545439][a list]] of my favorite recent albums from the
past year. People really enjoy reading lists, so pretty much every
music publication also releases a end-of-year list around the same
time [fn:aoty].

As fun as it is to parse through yearly lists, liking an album is no
guarantee of future streams. Sometimes there are albums like Sufjan
Steven's /Carrie & Lowell/ which, although exceptional, are do not
exactly make the best background music for homework. Other times
I might really en joy an album on repeat for a period of time, but
I eventually move on the something else. I might get a nice feeling
of nostalgia looking back at the record and how I now associate it
with that time period, but there would be no way to replicate that
initial infatuation.

In the streaming era, my music library is sometimes a bit like a
midnight refrigerator run: there's always plenty inside, but at the
moment I might just be looking for something quick and easy. Thus this
list is probably best described as my musical comfort food. There are
the albums from 2017 I had on repeat in my head and in my ears
throughout 2018.

*** Learning about each track

Great, so this is everything from the year, but I want to limit the
results to just albums from 2017. Unfortunately ListenBrainz does not
include a lot of metadata. We need [[https://musicbrainz.org/][MusicBrainz]] to help with this.
It's a huge database with just about every song, recording, and
album imaginable. Plus it has an API, so it's ideal for getting
information about each track.


Let's see this function in action.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :colnames no
getAlbums("Charli XCX", "Vroom Vroom")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: d4cc6eea-bf86-4c79-a5d9-2da07df19e0e

This result is exactly what we'd expect: it gives a unique string for
each release group in the MusicBrainz archive.

I'm going to take a shortcut here. I don't want to query every single
song I've ever heard. Since my end goal is to compile a list of albums
sorted by the number of songs played, it is safe to assume that albums
where I have only streamed two or three songs will not make that list.
To verify this, let's graph the distribution.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :exports both :results value file :var fname="images/playcounts.png" :colnames no
  library("plyr")
  playCounts <- count(recentPlays, c("artist_name", "track_name"))
  playCounts <- playCounts[order(playCounts$freq, decreasing=T), ]
  p <- ggplot(data=playCounts, aes(playCounts$freq)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1) +
       scale_y_sqrt() +
       theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
             legend.key = element_blank(),
             panel.background = element_blank(),
             plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent",colour = NA))
  ggsave(file=fname, plot=p, width=7, height=4, dpi=300, bg="transparent")
  fname
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/playcounts.png]]



As it turns out, I only listened to a majority of these songs only one
time. Taking out songs with fewer than three plays removes a bulk of
the songs from the log while likely keeping everything interesting.
Remember, I'm trying to end up with a list of albums. Since I
generally listen to complete albums, we can assume that each track on
any album which would make the list would have at least two plays.

# Note "Whole New World / Pretend World" is having an issue with that

Now grab the release groups (albums) for each track from MusicBrainz.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results silent
groups <- apply(mostFreqPlays, 1, function(x) getAlbums(x["artist_name"], x["track_name"]))
#+END_SRC

Get only the release groups with more than fifteen streams.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :colnames no
  library(tidyverse)

  mostFreqPlays$groups <- groups
  unnested <- mostFreqPlays %>%
      unnest(groups) %>%
      group_by(groups) %>%
      summarize(freq = sum(freq)) %>%
      arrange(desc(freq))
  nrow(unnested[unnested$freq > 15,])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 121

This yields 121 albums; however, we still don't know anything about
these releases. Thankfully MusicBrainz has this information as well.

Fetch metadata for each release.

#+END_SRC

We'll save this list for the rest of the post.

The last step I'll perform is creating the thumbnail collage
for this post.

  as <- aTable[order(aTable$freq, decreasing=T), ]
  r1 <- image_append(image_scale(image_read(getArt(rev(albums$groups)[1:4])), "250x250"))
  r2 <- image_append(image_scale(image_read(getArt(rev(albums$groups)[5:8])), "250x250"))
  r3 <- image_append(image_scale(image_read(getArt(rev(albums$groups)[c(9, 10, 12, 14)])), "250x250"))
  image_write(image_append(c(r1, r2, r3), stack=TRUE), "images/albums.png", format="png")

** The Albums

Now I'll say a few words about some of the albums on this list.

[[file:images/albums.png]]

*** Charli XCX - /Pop 2/

The prolific UK-based singer-songwriter has released a 
masterpiece. Featuring production from the likes of A.G. Cook
and SOPHIE, /Pop 2/ is a celebration of future-facing pop
music with catchy hooks and hyper-glossy production.

*** Lorde - /Melodrama/

I was completely blown away by this on my first listen.  Jack Antonoff
joined Lorde as executive producer and together they crafted a record
full of unexpected hooks and sleek arrangements. The fact that this
album is even being compared to Kate Bush's /Hounds of Love/ is a
testament to the songwriting chops of the young singer-songwriter.

*** Charli XCX - /Number 1 Angel/

Honestly I really wish that XCX3 got released last year as planned,
but these two mixtapes are possibly the greatest consolation prize
possible. PC Music-era Charli XCX just plain works. Perhaps the
most impressive accomplishment in these mixtapes is her ability
to feature so many other artists while at the same time not
being overshadowed in the slightest.

*** Rina Sawayama - /RINA/

I love the sound and aesthetic of pop music from the late 90's and
early 2000's. It's hard for me to describe, but there's just a level
of confidence to it that is difficult to reproduce. While Rina
Sawayama by no means tries to replicate the sound, she channels
it perfectly in this Clarence Clarity-produced EP.

*** Paramore - /After Laughter/

Does Hayley Williams have one of the best voices in today's music
industry? Yes. Does Paramore keep getting better and better over time?
Also yes.

*** Coma Cinema - /Loss Memory/

This was late release (early December) and it did not receive very
much attention from the music press. Nonetheless, I found it to be
a very enjoyable winter album with a raw yet removed approach to
its emotional subject matter.

*** Alex Cameron - /Forced Witness/

Heartland synthpop drenched in irony and social commentary. Cameron 
is simultaneously hilarious and thought-provoking.

*** Baths - /Romaplasm/

Bubbly production and chippy songwriting. It's a concept album.
I still don't quite get the concept, but that's okay.

*** Phoebe Bridgers - /Stranger in the Alps/

I didn't really get into this release until late this year.
Wow, there are some good songs in here! Another great winter
album with a lot of sad subjects, but also some intimate
and emotional arrangements.
