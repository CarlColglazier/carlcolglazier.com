* A Fast from Electron: Streaming Music through MPD
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: electron-fast
  :EXPORT_DATE: 2019-06-13
  :END:
Enough has been written on Electron's shortfalls that I feel no need to add my own gripes. Generally, I try to avoid it as much as possible. I'm sure the Discord desktop client is nice, but it also works just fine in my web browser. Slack? Okay, but you're only allowed on the work computer!

Despite my hesitations, one Electron app has constantly followed me around for years: the unofficial Google Play Music desktop player. Before you ask, no, I don't use Spotify. I do think it's the better-designed service, but GPM has a good family plan though and it comes with YouTube Red, which is a nice bonus.

Because of this setup, I basically have had a Chromium browser open on my computer at all times just to play music. What's the point of having 20 GB of RAM if I'm not trying to minimize its use at all times?

Here's what I'm using now instead:
- [[https://github.com/gmusicproxy/gmusicproxy][gmusicproxy]]
- [[https://www.musicpd.org/][Music Player Daemon (MPD)]]
- [[https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/mpdscribble][mpdscribble]]
- [[https://rybczak.net/ncmpcpp/][NCurses Music Player Client (Plus Plus)]]

The only real pain point in my workflow is searching for new albums which are not already in my playlists. I might write a simple program for that at some point.

Bonus: my scrobbles now cache if there is ever a connectivity issue.

This thought dump goes back to motivation. Why do I write? Why do I
post online? Who is my audience and what do they (and I) want?

If there is one thing I've learned about myself, it is that I can be
highly motivated by boredom. I'm happiest with my mind engaged on
solving some problem---even one of my own creation. So that's kind of
what I plan to do, at least for the time being. I think there's a hugo
pressure in many online spaces to reduce yourself to a brand.
YouTube, for instance, [[https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/lesson/niche][suggests channels discover and stick to a
specific niche]]. Fair advice if you are trying to grow on the platform,
but this approach may not be best for everyone.

In my head, my niche is very broad: media. It's what I study and my
primary personal interest as well. A lot of things fit in that label:
I define media as tools which transform our view of space and time.
This is pretty broad[fn:innis]. I see the overlap, but it's less clear
if anyone else would. No matter.

[fn:innis] And this is also clearly inspired by Harold Innis.
* Principles for Creative Work
  :PROPERTIES:

  :EXPORT_DATE: 2019-06-06

A lot of these ideas aren't original. In fact, many are borrowed from
processes in software development and team management I have learned
while a college student. I am writing them down here as a bit of a
self-reminder. This note isn't perfect, but....
** Perfection is a fantasy

Don't fall for it.

The idea of perfection comes the imagination: an unrealistic,
idealized version of ourselves with no basis in reality.  Most of the
time, "good enough" is good enough. The goal should never be
perfection.  Rather, ask what you are trying to convey? How do you
want people to feel? What do you want them to know? If you can say
you've put to form what you want the audience to experience, you have
succeeded.

Otherwise...

** Build quickly and fail cheaply.

I wrote this up as one principle because I think they are necessarily
linked to each other.  As a recovering perfectionist, I remain
astutely aware of failure. It's inevitable in nearly any project. The
best way to manage it is to incorporate it into the process. Create
opportunities to flesh out ideas and prototypes to avoid racking up
higher costs later on.

** Reduce workflow friction.

How much time are you actually working and how much time do you spend
on paperwork? This isn't to say documentation is useless.
Coordination and teamwork often are exactly the bottlenecks which need
to be eliminated.

** It's easiest after you start.

I did summer swim team for many years. In May and early June, getting
into the water was a real drudge. The air wasn't quite warm enough for
it to feel refreshing and the water hadn't warmed up enough from its
chilly tapwater origins. The thing is, you could spend forever building
everything up, waiting at the side of the pool. Trying to amp yourself
up. It gets you nowhere. The only way to get through it is to get started.
It sucks, but you get better at managing it.
