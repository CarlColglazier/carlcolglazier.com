While reading a YouTube comment section recently, I happened upon a
rather humorous comment claiming that "This is why Viners only act for
six seconds," referring to a prominent Vine user featured in the
YouTube video. Though the comment was likely meant as a joke, a series
of replies squabbled over the line between "Viners" and
"YouTubers". Some argued that since those in question started making
videos on YouTube, they were obviously "YouTubers". Others proposed
that since those in question were better known for their videos on
Vine, they must actually be "Viners". The line between creators on
these two website, it would appear, has become increasingly blurred.

But does such a line actually exist? Is there any noticeable or
notable difference between users on one online video sharing service
and other?

To answer these questions, it is important to consider what a
"YouTuber" is in the first place. The term "YouTuber" is often used to
label YouTube users.  Sometimes the term's use concerns any user of
YouTube, including commenters.  Others use the term when [discussing YouTube's regular video creators](http://video.pbs.org/video/2365039828/).  For the purpose of clarity, I
will be using the term henceforth under the latter use.

My main issue with using the term "YouTuber" is that it is often an
exclusionary term. The vast majority of active YouTube users have an
online presence beyond the video-based website. Most YouTube users,
for example, are active on social media websites such as
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CarlColglazier). For many of these users, their content on YouTube makes
up a larger brand that is visible in multiple locations. The product
in question (videos with ad-based revenue) are often hosted on and
distributed through YouTube, but YouTube is not their exclusive point
of interaction.

YouTube is only one outlet in the larger world of online video. This
world has existed long before YouTube and will likely exist long after
YouTube. With this in mind, calling some a "YouTuber" is a bit like
calling a musician from the 1980's a "cassetter" or an author of the
16th Century a "printing presser". The term simply does not fit.
