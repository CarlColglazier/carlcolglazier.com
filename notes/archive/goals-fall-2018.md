This fall semester, I want to...

Be a **good student** not just by doing the readings, but also by
investing in the topics. Set myself up for success by allocating
enough time to do things well. Remember what is important. Focus on
the 20% that gets me 80% of the evaluation and move
on[^fn:1]. Keep in mind that learning is more important than
grades.

Prepare for **the future**. Work on research and side projects to
refine and demonstrate my skills. Read books. Study for the GRE. Take
on challenges. Consciously develop life skills.

**Prioritize health**. Keep a consistent sleep schedule. Set exercise
goals and work toward them. Take regular breaks. Reach out.

**Focus on habits**. Use systems that work like flashcards. Emphasize
the long-term over the short-term. Maintain things that matter. Give
space and grace to slip up.

**Be authentic** with humility. Know my limits. Allow vulnerability.
Treat others unreasonably well.
