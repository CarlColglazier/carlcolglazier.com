## The latest and greatest

**Completing my [dissertation](https://ftsw.carl.cx/dissertation.html) work.** I am a doctoral candidate and "all but dissertation" (ABD).

**Planning my wedding** in September.

**On the job market.** If you are in the Chicago area, feel free to reach out!

## I am currently hacking on

- [My website](https://github.com/carlcolglazier/carlcolglazier.com), which hosts a few data science projects under [`notes/`](https://carlcolglazier.com/notes/)
- [`bsky-sampler`](https://github.com/CarlColglazier/bsky-sampler), an esoteric API that returns the text from $n = 1$ of my recent Bluesky posts.
- [`Olearia`](https://github.com/CarlColglazier/Olearia), a custom firmware for the ElectroSmith Daisy Patch Eurorack module.
